# Create a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application using Prompt flow
 In this lab, you will create a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application using Prompt flow. You will also learn how to test the RAG application using Prompt Flow.

 ## Prerequisites
 - Access to AI Hub resource in Azure AI Studio. You can [create an AI Hub resource in Azure AI Studio] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-azure-ai-resource#create-an-azure-ai-hub-resource-in-ai-studio) if you don't have one.
 - Create a new AI project in Azure AI Studio. You can [create a new RAG application in Azure AI Studio] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-rag-application) if you don't have one.
 - Access to Azure OpenAI service
 - Access to Azure AI Search service
 - Access to Azure Blob Storage

 ## Lab Scenarios
 1. Create a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application using Prompt flow. This application will use AI Search to retrieve relevant information and then use Azure OpenAI service to generate a response.
 - You can create a RAG application using Azure AI Studio OR
 - You can import a pre-built RAG application from Azure AI Studio.

 2. Test RAG application using PromptFlow.

 Follow the instructions provided in the lab document to complete the tasks.

## Lab Implementation
Follow step-by-step instructions provided in the lab guide (RAG-application-Promptflow.pdf) to implement the lab scenario.
